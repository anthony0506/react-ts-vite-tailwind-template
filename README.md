# React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS

App template using React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS

## Motivation

Lightning-fast startups with instant hot module replacement and complex responsive layout creation using Vite, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

This starter uses following libraries:

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript

## Set up

```shell
mv .env.local.example .env.local
yarn
yarn dev
```

## React

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Vite

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a fast frontend build tool.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is a superset of JavaScript. It is just one of NPM library, but it provides an original compiler.

When you use TypeScript with React, you can write JSX with TypeScript, called TSX. Then you can develop views written by **Type-Safe** template.

## How was it builded?

- Create Vite app for React with TypeScript
  Run `yarn create vite react-ts-vite-tailwindcss-template --template react-ts`
